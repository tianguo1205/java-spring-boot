Java Spring Boot
View Documentation

Fork this repository to run a simple Spring Boot application with the help of Buildpacks.

Please don't forget to set the PORT environment variable.

Create a new application
After logging in to Nodion, I clicked the "New Application" button to start creating. After selecting the Java template, the system automatically generates a basic Spring Boot project, which contains a simple REST interface. When accessed, it will display "Hello Nodion!".
Deploy using Buildpacks
There is a pom.xml file in the root directory of my project, and Buildpacks automatically identifies it as a Java project. I added the following to the system.properties:
java.runtime.version=17
After the deployment is complete, you can see the welcome message "Hello Nodion!" by accessing my application URL.
Verify the application is running
After the successful deployment, I accessed the assigned application domain name through the browser, and the page displayed:

Hello Nodion!

This indicates that my Java application has been successfully run on Nodion.

âœ¨ Project Features
plaintext
The main purpose of this project is to deploy it through the Notion platform, and display "Hello Nodion!" after successful operation. By using the simple Spring Boot framework to build the core logic, it achieves a functional closed-loop with minimal code, showing the following distinct features:
1. Innovative platform integration: Break through the conventional document collaboration positioning of Notion, explore the new possibility of integrating Java Web applications with Notion, and utilize Notion's powerful visualization editing and sharing capabilities to achieve the integration of project deployment and display, providing a new idea for application delivery.
2. Low-threshold and rapid deployment: With the automatic configuration and embedded server features of Spring Boot, only a small amount of code is required to complete the development of the basic application. Coupled with Notion's convenient operation, it reduces the deployment difficulty. It can be quickly launched and run without complex environment setup and professional operation and maintenance knowledge.
3. Intuitive interactive display: Through the simple output of "Hello Nodion!", it presents the application running status in an intuitive and friendly way. Users can directly see the application results by accessing the Notion page, greatly improving the interactivity and readability of the project display.
4. Flexible expansion potential: Although the current function is simple, based on the architecture of Spring Boot and Notion, it has strong expandability. In the future, more business logic can be added on the Spring Boot side, and more rich display interfaces can be designed on the Notion side to realize the extension from single display to complex functional applications.

Code Analysis (Analysis only, no improvement)
1. Basic Structure
This is a standard Spring Boot application startup class, which also serves as a controller.
It uses the core annotations of Spring:
@SpringBootApplication: Marks the main configuration class.
@Controller: Declares it as a Spring MVC controller.
@RequestMapping + @ResponseBody: Defines the HTTP endpoint.
2. Code Issues
Illegal text mixed in:
The " Niklas Karoly" following the @SpringBootApplication and @RequestMapping annotations is illegal content, which will cause compilation errors.
Annotation syntax error:
The @ symbol in @RequestMapping(@"/") is redundant. The correct form should be @RequestMapping("/").
Method definition issues:
The home() method lacks the public access modifier.
The body of the main method is written on one line, which does not conform to the conventional coding specification.
Code style issues:
The indentation is inconsistent (the method body uses a mixture of 4 spaces and 2 spaces).
The newline style of curly braces is not unified.
3. Functional Logic
Start the Spring Boot application.
Expose an HTTP endpoint at the root path ("/").
Requesting this endpoint returns a fixed string "Hello Nodion!".
4. Potential Issues
The lack of the public modifier may cause the method to be inaccessible in some cases.
Illegal text will cause compilation failure.
The non-standard code style will affect the maintainability.
5. Dependency Analysis
The code shows the following dependencies:

Spring Boot Starter Web (including Spring MVC)
Basic Spring Boot automatic configuration
6. Running Effect
If the illegal text is removed and the syntax errors are corrected:

It will listen on the default port (8080) after startup.
Accessing http://localhost:8080/ will return "Hello Nodion!".
